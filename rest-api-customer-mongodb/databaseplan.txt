In a hospital there are different departments.

 Patients are treated in these departments by the doctors assigned to patients.
 
 Usually each patient is treated by a single doctor,
  but in rare cases they will have two or three.
  
   Healthcare assistants will also attend to patients;
   
    every department has many healthcare assistants.
    
     Each patient is required to take a variety of drugs during different parts of the day such as morning, afternoon and night.
